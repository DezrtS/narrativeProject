    You get 2 minutes to search around the house
    looking for items you can interact with. Interacted items will create journal
    entries where you can learn more about them. Try to focus more on quickly picking
    up evidence rather than taking your time to look things over. You''ll get more
    time to look through all your journal entries after your 2 minutes are up.'
